def encoded_from_base10(number, base, digit_map):

    This function returns a string encoding in the "base" for the the "number" using the "digit_map"
    Conditions that this function must satisfy:
    - 2 <= base <= 36 else raise ValueError
    - invalid base ValueError must have relevant information
    - digit_map must have sufficient length to represent the base
    - must return proper encoding for all base ranges between 2 to 36 (including)
    - must return proper encoding for all negative "numbers" (hint: this is equal to encoding for +ve number, but with - sign added)
    - the digit_map must not have any repeated character, else ValueError
    - the repeating character ValueError message must be relevant
    - you cannot use any in-built functions in the MATH module
